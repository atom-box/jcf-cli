# Jedi Code Formatter CLI

I took Jedi Code Formatter from Lazarus repository and made it as CLI version by removing all the GUI parts from the original GUI version. The CLI version can be used as Pascal code formatter in Visual Studio, or as backend engine of an online Pascal code formatter.

Here's JCF CLI in action within Visual Studio Code (with OmniPascal):

Hope it's gonna be useful for other Pascal fellows out there. Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
