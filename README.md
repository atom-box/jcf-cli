# Jedi Code Formatter CLI

I took [Jedi Code Formatter](http://jedicodeformat.sourceforge.net/) (JCF) from [Lazarus repository](https://github.com/graemeg/lazarus/tree/upstream/components/jcf2) and made it as CLI (command line interface) version by removing all the GUI (graphical user interface) parts from the original GUI version. The CLI version can be used as Pascal code formatter in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or as backend engine of an online Pascal code formatter.

Here's JCF CLI in action within VS Code ([with OmniPascal](http://www.omnipascal.com/)):

Hope it's gonna be useful for other Pascal fellows out there. Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
